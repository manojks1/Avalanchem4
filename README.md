## Description

DegenToken is a foundational Ethereum token built following the ERC-20 standard. It encompasses features such as token minting, burning, and redemption tailored for particular actions. This initiative is designed as an entry point for individuals keen on delving into Ethereum token development or constructing customized tokens with distinct functionalities.

Delve into the source code to grasp the architecture of the token contract and adapt it according to your needs. Whether for educational purposes or as a baseline for advanced token development, this project offers a versatile starting point. It can also be seamlessly integrated into decentralized applications (DApps) for enhanced functionality.
## Installation

1)To download the project, clone the repository:
 https://github.com/Metacrafters/DegenToken

2)Modify in the DegenToken.sol file
    
## Usage

1)Deploy the contract to the Ethereum network using Remix or another Solidity compiler. Make sure to set the name and symbol for your token.

2)Once the contract is deployed, call the mint function to create new tokens and assign them to an address. This function can only be called by the contract owner.

3)Use the transfer function to send tokens from one address to another.
